## The browser for developers.
Turbo is built with Electron and React, this makes it an embedded Chrome application. In simpler terms, it packs the power and some of the security that comes with Google Chrome but it doesn't have any of the data tracking and privacy breaches that Chrome comes with. All parsing of a website's HTML and CSS is done by Electron (embedded Chrome) but we add what makes Turbo the browser for developers. Turbo comes with a bunch of features from an integrated API client (like Postman) and localhost to public port tunneling (like ngrok) to easily customizable themes and a fully keyboard navigationable interface. We're currently working on Turbo and it's in a closed beta stage!

## Opensource & Building in public
Turbo is completely opensource and we're building it in public on [Twitter](https://twitter.turbobrowser.io/) and [Discord](https://discord.turbobrowser.io). What does this mean?

According to [@heyblake](https://twitter.com/heyblake), building in public means sharing -
- Wins
- Losses
- Strategy
- Processes
- Behind the scenes
- Documentation
- Resources
- Methods
- Systems
- Updates
- Ideas
- Fears
- Tools

This is basically the same attitude we take towards Turbo's opensource and building in public status. Although we're pretty new to this, we want Turbo development to be as transparent and inclusive as possible!

If you're making a Turbo fork or clone, make sure you read through our [license](https://github.com/teamcodebyte/turbo/blob/main/LICENSE.md). We do not appreciate people publishing clones of Turbo, and abusing it's opensource status.

## Development
Here's a guide on running Turbo locally. If you're on a local fork of Turbo, make sure you are on the staging branch.

### Running developmnt server
- run ``npm install`` to install all our dependencies
- run ``npm run start`` to start our frontend
- wait till it opens a chrome tab at localhost:3000, close the tab and run ``npm run dev``
- it should open a new window with Turbo!

## Building
Still working on this, need to make it cross-os compatible.
